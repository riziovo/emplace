# emplace

This project was borne out of curiosity for the type of problems that a high-traffic classified website would face.

This project is third on my PRIORITY chart. I aim to come around to it in September for a major architectural shift.

All of the optimizations, so far, need to happen in the models and database area it appears to me. At the moment, all the optimizations are done via native queries. I want to move away from Hibernate when I revisit this project.

The level of Caching, Persistence Strategies, Indexing, Batching, ETL , are some of the areas it demands to be answered. These are some of my favourite problems to work on.

This is esentially a Backend project. Nonetheless, in the coming months I plan to start working on the UI. But first, the Backend needs my attention.

### BACKEND
Java
Spring Framework
Hibernate
SQL
JDBC

### WHATS NEXT ~ V2
1. Make it Faster, Lighter, Robust.
2. Redesign it around A MQ architecture.
3. Move away from the SPRING ecosystem.
4. Emphasis on Database Re-Design.
5. Non-Blocking IO.
